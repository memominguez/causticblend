## Blending Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solutions

This application was developed in ReactJS

This application deals with the relationship among NaOH solutions properties: Weight%, Specific gravity, and °Bé gravity.

The components BlenderV.js and BlenderW.js solve for blending two solutions. Volume basis and weight basis, respectively.

Please refer to the component Instructions.js

Calculations are based on a table version of a NaOH specific gravity vrs weight%. Please refer to component Tables.js

A user may input a different version of NaOH solutions table, using the same format.
